/**
 * This component is used to wrap Input and Textarea components to optimize form re-render.
 * These 2 are the only components that trigger form model change on each character input.
 * This means, whenever you type a letter an entire form re-renders.
 * On complex forms you will feel and see a significant delay if this component is not used.
 *
 * The logic behind this component is to serve as a middleware between Form and Input/Textarea, and only notify form of a change when
 * a user stops typing for given period of time (400ms by default).
