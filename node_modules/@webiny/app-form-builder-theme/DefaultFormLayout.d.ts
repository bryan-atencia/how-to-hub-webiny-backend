/**
 * This is the default form layout component, in which we render all the form fields. We also render terms of service
 * and reCAPTCHA (if enabled in form settings), and at the bottom, the submit button. Note that we also utilized
 * the "webiny-form" package, which makes working with forms and form fields a walk in the park. Also, as labels for
 * various parts of the form can be translated to different languages via the Form Editor (eg. submit button's label,
 * terms of service message...), we use the I18NValue component, which is a part of the "webiny-app-i18n" package.
 *
 * Feel free to use this component as your starting point for your own form layouts. Add or remove things as you like!
